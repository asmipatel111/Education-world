            <p class="sec2sub  text-small1">Education can be characterized from the teacher's or the student's perspective.
                Teacher-centered definitions focus on the perspective and role of the teacher, for example, in the form of 
                transmitting knowledge and skills while doing so in a morally appropriate manner.Student-centered definitions,
                on the other hand, outline education based on the student's experience in the learning process, for example,
                based on how education transforms and enriches their subsequent experience. However, conceptualizations taking
                both perspectives into account are also possible. This can take the form of describing the process as the shared
                experience of a common world.</p>

            <p class="sec2sub  text-small1">Informal learning is one of three forms of learning defined by the Organisation
                for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Informal learning occurs in a variety of places, such as at
                home, work, and through daily interactions and shared relationships among members of society. For many learners,
                this includes language acquisition, cultural norms, and manners.A volunteer reads aloud to children in Laos.In
                informal learning, there is often a reference person, a peer or expert, to guide the learner. If learners have
                a personal interest in what they are informally being taught, learners tend to expand their existing knowledge
                and conceive new ideas about the topic being learned </p>

            <p class="sec2sub  text-small1">After the public school system was widely developed beginning in the 19th century, alternative
                education developed in part as a reaction to perceived limitations and failings of traditional education. A broad range of
                educational approaches emerged, including alternative schools, self learning, homeschooling, and unschooling. Example alternative
                schools include Montessori schools, Waldorf schools (or Steiner schools), Friends schools, Sands School, Summerhill School,
                Walden's Path, The Peepal Grove School, Sudbury Valley School, Krishnamurti schools, and open classroom schools.Charter schools
                are another example of alternative education, which have in the recent years grown in numbers in the US and gained greater
                importance in its public education system</p>
